    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 1: Getting Started with C++</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Welcome to the exciting world of C++ programming! This book is designed to make learning C++
      fun and engaging by focusing on creating games and graphics from the very beginning.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why C++?</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      C++ is one of the most powerful programming languages used in game development today. From AAA
      titles to indie games, C++ provides the performance and control needed to create amazing
      interactive experiences.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What You'll Need</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li>A C++ compiler (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or g++)</li>
      <li>A graphics library (we'll use SDL2 or SFML)</li>
      <li>Enthusiasm and curiosity!</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Throughout this book, you'll build real projects that you can show to friends and family.
      Each chapter builds on the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts through hands-on examples.
    </p>

  <section id="chapter-2" class="chapter-section mb-16">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 2: Your First Graphics Window</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Creating a window is the first step in any graphics application. In this chapter, you'll learn
      how to initialize a graphics system and create your first window.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Setting Up SDL2</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform library that makes it easy to handle graphics,
      audio, and input in C++. Let's start by creating a simple window.
    </p>

    <div class="mockup-code mb-4">
      <pre><code>{`#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow(
        "My First Window",
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        800, 600,
        SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN
    );

    SDL_Delay(3000); // Keep window open for 3 seconds

    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}`}</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Congratulations! You've just created your first graphics window. In the next chapter,
      we'll learn how to draw shapes and colors inside this window.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Chapter 3 -->
  <section id="chapter-3" class="chapter-section mb-16">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 3: Drawing Shapes and Colors</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Now that we have a window, let's make it colorful! In this chapter, you'll learn how to
      draw basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Understanding the Coordinate System</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In computer graphics, the origin (0, 0) is typically at the top-left corner of the window.
      The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Drawing Your First Rectangle</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Let's draw a red rectangle in the center of our window:

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 4: Animation Basics</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Animation brings your graphics to life! In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamentals of
      creating smooth movement and animation in your programs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Game Loop</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Every game and animated program uses a game loop - a continuous cycle that updates the game
      state and renders graphics. Here's the basic structure:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Process Input:</strong> Check for keyboard, mouse, or controller input</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Update:</strong> Change positions, velocities, and game state</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Render:</strong> Draw everything to the screen</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Repeat:</strong> Go back to step 1</li>
